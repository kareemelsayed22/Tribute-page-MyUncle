              He was born in Cairo, the capital of Egypt (Africa),
              on May 13th, 1975. Obtained a degree in Land Surveying Engineering, and pursued
              a successful career around Africa working in countries like Tanzania. Even worked in Yemen and Saudi Arabia before discovering that he had cancer. A year after his daugher was born.
              <br>
              <strong>The first male in my mothers family
              </strong>, To be the first born male in a middle eastern family. That came with
              lots of privilages. ALso in Egypt that meant mandatory army time once his younger brother arrived. He was forced to serve in the Egyptian army while attending college. This is exactly what happened to him. Right after my second uncle was born.
              Both brothers are 8 years apart. Together with his brother, they raised me and my sister in Egypt with the guidance of my grandparents. We all lived in seperate places. Somehow my extened family always found a way to unite on a daily basis. The first man to attain a college degree
              in the Abdallah Abdou Hussen family tree.

              Mohamed Abdallah was <span class="font-weight-bold"> an average man,
              acknowledged by me ever since I started speaking my first words. Not a day goes by without him on my mind.</span>.
              He was a great human being. Loved to workout. Played pool with his friends a lot in the streets of Al-Mohandessin, Egypt where he was raised. A great swimmer that used to do acrobatic moves in swimming pools as well.
              In my family, he was the guy who laughed the most and made plenty of jokes. His smile brightened our days.
